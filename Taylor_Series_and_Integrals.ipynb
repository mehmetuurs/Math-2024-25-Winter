        "**Solutions and Explanations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **$\\int 1 dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $x + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** This is like asking, \"What function, when you find its slope (derivative), gives you 1?\" The answer is simply 'x' (because the slope of 'x' is always 1). The '+ C' part represents any constant value, which wouldn't change the slope. **Formula:  $\\int k dx = kx + C$, where k is a constant.**\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **$\\int (x^2 + 2) dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $\\frac{x^3}{3} + 2x + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** We break this down into smaller parts. The integral of 'x^2' is 'x^3/3' (like reversing the power rule for derivatives). The integral of '2' is '2x' (similar to the first problem). We add these results and include the '+ C' for any constant. **Formula: $\\int (x^n + k) dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + kx + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **$\\int 2\\sin(x) dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $-2\\cos(x) + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** The integral of 'sin(x)' is '-cos(x)' (a fundamental rule in calculus). Since we have '2sin(x)', we multiply the result by 2 and add '+ C'.  **Formula: $\\int k\\sin(x) dx = -k\\cos(x) + C$, where k is a constant.**\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **$\\int 3x dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $\\frac{3x^2}{2} + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** The integral of 'x' is 'x^2/2' (reversing the power rule). We multiply this by the constant '3' and add '+ C'. **Formula: $\\int kx dx = \\frac{kx^2}{2} + C$, where k is a constant.**\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **$\\int 1x^2 dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $\\frac{x^3}{3} + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** This is the same as the integral of 'x^2', which is 'x^3/3', plus the constant of integration '+ C'. **Formula: $\\int x^2 dx = \\frac{x^3}{3} + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **$\\int (13x^4 - 5) dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $\\frac{13x^5}{5} - 5x + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** We treat each part separately. The integral of '13x^4' is '13x^5/5' (power rule in reverse). The integral of '-5' is '-5x'. We combine them and add '+ C'.  **Formula: $\\int (ax^n + b) dx = \\frac{ax^{n+1}}{n+1} + bx + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **$\\int (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $x + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** This uses a trigonometric identity: 'sin^2(x) + cos^2(x)' always equals '1'. So, we're really just finding the integral of '1', which is 'x + C'. **Formula: $\\int (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) dx = \\int 1 dx = x + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **$\\int (5\\sin x + 3e^x) dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $-5\\cos x + 3e^x + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** We integrate each part. The integral of '5sin(x)' is '-5cos(x)'. The integral of '3e^x' is '3e^x' (a special case). We add them together and include '+ C'. **Formula: $\\int (a\\sin x + be^x) dx = -a\\cos x + be^x + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **$\\int x^3 dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $\\frac{x^4}{4} + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** Applying the power rule in reverse, the integral of 'x^3' is 'x^4/4', plus the constant '+ C'. **Formula: $\\int x^3 dx = \\frac{x^4}{4} + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **$\\int 10x dx$**\n",
        "   - **Solution:** $5x^2 + C$\n",
        "   - **Explanation:** Similar to the '3x' example, the integral of 'x' is 'x^2/2'. We multiply by 10 to get '5x^2', and add the '+ C'. **Formula: $\\int kx dx = \\frac{kx^2}{2} + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **$\\int \\cos(\\frac{5}{2}x + 3) dx$**\n",
        "    - **Solution:** $\\frac{2}{5}\\sin(\\frac{5}{2}x + 3) + C$\n",
        "    - **Explanation:** This one uses a technique called 'substitution'. We imagine the inside part ('(5/2)x + 3') as a single variable (like 'u'). Then we adjust to integrate with respect to 'u' and substitute back at the end. It's like peeling back layers to get to a simpler problem. **Formula: $\\int \\cos(ax + b) dx = \\frac{1}{a}\\sin(ax + b) + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "12. **$\\int \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} dx$**\n",
        "    - **Solution:** $\\sin(\\ln(x)) + C$\n",
        "    - **Explanation:** Similar to the previous one, we use substitution. We treat 'ln(x)' as a single variable and adjust the integral accordingly. **Formula: $\\int \\frac{\\cos(\\ln(x))}{x} dx = \\sin(\\ln(x)) + C$**\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **$\\int x\\ln(x) dx$**\n",
        "    - **Solution:** $\\frac{x^2}{2}\\ln(x) - \\frac{x^2}{4} + C$\n",
        "    - **Explanation:** This uses a method called 'integration by parts', which is a way to handle integrals of products of functions. It involves carefully choosing parts of the expression and applying a specific formula.  **Formula: $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$**\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **$\\int xe^x dx$**\n",
        "    - **Solution:** $xe^x - e^x + C$\n",
        "    - **Explanation:** Like the previous problem, this uses integration by parts to handle the product of 'x' and 'e^x'. Applying the method leads to the solution, and we add '+ C' for the constant of integration. **Formula: $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$**"
